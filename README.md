## Western Massachusetts Policy Center

For the Western Massachusetts Policy Center (WMPC), a 501(c)(3) operating in Western Massachusetts, I was asked to make a few updates to their site.

As I don't live in Massachusetts, I worked with them remotely, to update their site.

Again, this was a Wordpress/Elementor site, some of the work I did was fairly easy, but I was able to learn how to apply filters to pages and how to add data to the backend of the site.

Tasks I completed:
- On the home page, filtering and displaying the four most-recent articles into the 'OUR LATEST' section.
- Exporting the 'OUR PEOPLE' element of the About page to its own page
- Entering data, bios and pics, to the backend of the site
- Linking their Merch store to the site
- Adding filters to the 'POLICY WORK' page
